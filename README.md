Predicting phase prototypes of inorganic substances through transfer learning

 CNNs were trained on a big dataset of 228,676 compounds from open quantum materials database (OQMD). The feature extractors of the well-trained CNNs were reused for feature extraction on a phase prototypes dataset containing 17,762 inorganic substances and involving 170 phase prototypes. Random forest was then utilized as classifier.
